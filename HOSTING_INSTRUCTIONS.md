# 🚀 HOST YOUR TIKTOK BOT - CHOOSE YOUR METHOD

## 🎯 Quick Decision Guide

**I want to test locally (easiest):**
→ Run `./deploy_local.sh`

**I want it online for free:**
→ Deploy to Railway.app (see below)

**I have a VPS/server:**
→ Use Docker: `docker-compose up -d`

---

## Method 1: Local Hosting (30 seconds) ⚡

```bash
# Start server
./deploy_local.sh

# Your bot is now at: http://localhost:5000
# Stop with: ./stop_server.sh
```

**Pros:** Instant, free, full control
**Cons:** Only accessible from your network

---

## Method 2: Railway.app (2 minutes) 🚂 [RECOMMENDED]

**FREE hosting with public URL!**

1. Go to https://railway.app and sign up
2. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub"
3. Connect this repository
4. Railway auto-detects and deploys!
5. Get your public URL: `https://your-bot.railway.app`

**OR use Railway CLI:**
```bash
npm i -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

**Pros:** Free, public URL, auto-deploy, SSL
**Cons:** None really!

---

## Method 3: Render.com (2 minutes) 🎨

**FREE tier available!**

1. Go to https://render.com
2. New → Web Service
3. Connect this repo
4. Settings already configured (render.yaml)
5. Click Deploy!

**Your URL:** `https://your-bot.onrender.com`

**Pros:** Free SSL, auto-deploy
**Cons:** Spins down after inactivity (free tier)

---

## Method 4: Docker (Anywhere) 🐳

```bash
# Local
docker-compose up -d

# VPS/Server
docker build -t tiktok-bot .
docker run -d -p 80:5000 tiktok-bot
```

**Access:** http://your-server-ip

**Pros:** Works anywhere, consistent
**Cons:** Requires Docker knowledge

---

## Method 5: Heroku (Classic) 🟣

```bash
heroku create your-tiktok-bot
git push heroku main
heroku open
```

**Pros:** Well-known, reliable
**Cons:** No longer has free tier
